# NYCPublicLibraryApp
Single view app that displays Brooklyn and Queens public library branches.

## Problem

I used to visit public library branches on regular basis to do schoolwork and check out books. Each time I would like to look up the library branch's information, such as their phone number, address, and hours of operation. 

## App Features

This app was built to list all the public library branches in the New York City boroughs Brooklyn and Queens.  The branches are listed in alphabetical order by their name.  When clicked, information on the branch's phone number, exact address, and hours of operation are displayed. The information is also clickable so that the phone can directly call the number, get the address to find direction, or add hours of operation to the calendar.
