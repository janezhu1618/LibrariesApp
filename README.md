# NYCPublicLibraryApp
Single view app that displays Brooklyn and Queens public library branches.

## Problem

I used to visit public library branches on regular basis to do schoolwork and check out books. Each time I would like to look up the library branch's information, such as their phone number, address, and hours of operation. Eventually, it became too much work to try to remember each library's hours and address. I needed an easier way to access these information.

## App Features

This app was built to list all the public libraries in New York City's five borooughs, Brookly, Manhattan, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens.  The branches are listed in alphabetical order by their name.  When clicked, information on the branch's phone number, address, hours of operation, and map are displayed. The information is also clickable so that the phone can directly call the number, get the address to find direction, or add hours of operation to the calendar. The map displays the neighborhood of the library, which makes it easier to locate the library based on obvious landmarks presented. 

A new feature that was added to this app is the ability to "bookmark" or favorite libraries. All the bookmarked libraries are saved onto a list on one of the tabs to be accessed.
